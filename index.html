        <h2>What is Google Developer Group?</h2>
            <p>Google Developer Groups (GDG) is a community-driven initiative supported by Google. 
                It is designed for student developers, tech enthusiasts, and professionals to learn, share, and connect around Google technologies and other relevant topics in software development. At GDG on Campus at CityTech, I coordinate with Google employees to bring this valuable resource to students. 
                Members will have the opportunity to attend in-person and virtual events, including hackathons, panel discussions, and networking sessions. 
                Students will also have the chance to explore the latest technologies, collaborate on exciting projects, and grow both personally and professionally in a supportive environment.

            <h2>Google Launchpad</h2>
            <p>Starting in January 2024, Google will be announcing their pilot program Google Launchpad. 
                This is one of their many accelerator programs that empower startups, developers, and nonprofits.
                The benefits of this launchpad allow students to take a Google Cloud course, which
                they complete over the course of a few months and receive a certificate at the end.
                Taking advantage of this opportunity as a student is crucial to help build your resume and
                stand out for internship applications. </p>
